# **Welcome to the Lab**

This blog is a technical record of my work in cybersecurity. I use it to document investigations, break down CTF challenges, publish walkthroughs, and share research notes that might help others working in the same domain.

# **What You’ll Find Here**

CTF Writeups — Clear, step-by-step solutions with reasoning, tooling, and exploitation logic.
Security Tutorials — Practical guides on core concepts, methodologies, and modern defensive/attacker techniques.
Project Notes — Experiments, tools, and implementations from my personal research.
Walkthroughs — Deep dives into platforms like PortSwigger Labs, TryHackMe, and other structured learning environments.

# **Purpose**

This space exists to provide technically accurate, reproducible material for fellow security researchers and to maintain a transparent record of my own growth in offensive and defensive security. Everything here is hands-on, tested, and focused on real-world relevance.

Welcome aboard.
