# **About**

I’m CYB3R BO1, a cybersecurity researcher and CTF practitioner. My work revolves around studying offensive and defensive security techniques, building tooling, and analyzing how systems break—and how they can be made resilient.

# **Focus Areas**

Web and Network Security — Vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and protocol behavior.
Reverse Engineering and Exploit Development — Understanding binaries, debugging, and developing practical exploits.
Digital Forensics and Incident Response — System analysis, memory forensics, and investigation workflows.
Cryptography and Secure System Design — Applied crypto, implementation weaknesses, and protocol logic.

# **What This Blog Contains**

This site is a technical archive of my work: CTF writeups, walkthroughs of structured security labs, experiments, prototypes, and research notes. Everything here is documented with reproducibility and clarity in mind, both for my own reference and for anyone else working in similar domains.

If you find something here useful, that’s a welcome side effect. The main goal is to maintain a public, accurate record of the problems I study and the solutions I build.
